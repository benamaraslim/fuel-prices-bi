# Fuel Prices BI Dashboard

> **v0.0** — Initial release · No UI design applied yet

A complete **Power BI analytics project** tracking global fuel prices across 150+ countries, built with a full data engineering stack.

---

## Purpose & Business Decisions

This dashboard transforms raw fuel price data from 60 countries into **actionable intelligence** for three types of stakeholders.

### Target Users

| User | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Governments / Policy makers** | Benchmark taxation, evaluate subsidy costs, plan energy transition |
| **Economic / Financial analysts** | Track Brent ↔ pump price correlation, assess oil shock impact on economies |
| **Transport & Logistics companies** | Optimize routing by fuel cost, anticipate price increases, plan fleet electrification |

---

### Key Decisions Enabled

**Government — Subsidy Policy**
- 12 Asian countries spend **$35.9B/year** on subsidies → decide whether to maintain, reduce, or better target (e.g. means-tested subsidies instead of universal)
- Brunei subsidizes at $0.31/L → sustainable while oil revenues hold, but structurally risky long-term

**Government — Taxation & Carbon Policy**
- France (58% tax rate) generates massive revenue but risks energy poverty → decide on price cap or energy voucher compensation
- Only 11 countries have a carbon tax → the other 49 can use this data to model the impact before adopting one

**Government — Energy Transition**
- Asia: **2,087 MT CO2** from transport with only **1.96% EV penetration** → accelerate EV purchase incentives
- South Korea (10%) and China (9.4%) prove that strong policy produces results → replicable model

**Companies — Logistics & Routing**
- Route freight through low-fuel-cost countries (Brunei $0.31, Malaysia $0.50) → reduce operating costs
- Avoid Netherlands/Norway ($2.10/L) for long-haul land routes

**Companies — Investment & Hedging**
- Brent/WTI spread of **$18.80** → arbitrage opportunity for oil traders
- YoY +8.4% → anticipate rising logistics costs and reprice contracts accordingly
- Brent/pump correlation r=0.87 → every +$10/bbl Brent = +$0.08/L at the pump → hedge via futures contracts
- MoM +1.1% sustained → ~14% annual increase → negotiate fixed-price supply agreements now

**Companies — Fleet Decisions**
- Countries with high EV adoption (South Korea, China) → invest in electric fleets before fuel costs rise further
- Countries with carbon tax → diesel will keep getting more expensive → switch to LNG or EV

### One-Line Summary

> This dashboard answers **"Where, when, and how much to invest in or tax fuel"** — with hard numbers to justify every decision in front of shareholders, ministers, or a board of directors.

## Data Analysis & Key Findings

### Vue Globale — Prix des Carburants
![Vue Globale](screenshots/dashboard_overview.png)

**Global overview across 60 countries:**

| KPI | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Average gasoline price | **$1.095 / L** |
| Cheapest country | **$0.020 / L** (Libya / Venezuela — heavily subsidized) |
| Most expensive country | **$2.100 / L** (Netherlands) |
| Price spread (max − min) | **$2.080** — enormous global disparity |

**Top 8 most expensive:** Netherlands, Norway, Israel, France, Italy, Singapore, Germany, Switzerland — all high-income countries with heavy fuel taxation.

**Regional averages:** Europe leads (~$1.70/L), followed by Oceania (~$1.30/L). Middle East and Southeast Asia are the cheapest regions due to subsidies and local oil production.

> The **105x price ratio** between the cheapest and most expensive country reflects the massive impact of government subsidies and taxation — not just production costs.

---

### Tendances — Évolution des Prix (2015–2026)
![Tendances](screenshots/dashboard_tendances.png)

**Price trend indicators:**

| KPI | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Average monthly gasoline | **$0.762 / L** |
| Month-over-Month change | **+1.1%** |
| Year-over-Year change | **+8.4%** |
| Brent crude (latest) | **$92.40 / bbl** |
| WTI crude (latest) | **$73.60 / bbl** |

**Key observations from the 2015–2026 curve:**

- **2015–2016:** Sharp drop from ~$0.85/L to ~$0.45/L — OPEC supply glut, Brent fell below $30/bbl
- **2020:** Historic low (~$0.40/L) — COVID-19 demand collapse; Brent briefly went negative (April 2020)
- **2021–2022:** Rapid surge to ~$1.20/L peak — post-COVID recovery + Russia-Ukraine war pushed Brent above $120/bbl
- **2023–2024:** Gradual normalization around $0.80–0.90/L
- **2026:** Rising again (+8.4% YoY) — renewed supply constraints and geopolitical pressure

> The **Brent/WTI spread of $18.80** ($92.40 − $73.60) is unusually wide, signaling logistical bottlenecks or quality differentials in the current market.

### Analyse Asie — Accessibilité & Transition Énergétique
![Analyse Asie](screenshots/dashboard_asie.png)

**Asia-specific metrics:**

| KPI | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Avg Affordability Index | **33.4** |
| Avg EV Adoption | **1.96%** |
| Total CO2 (Transport) | **2,087 MT** |
| Total Subsidy Cost | **$35.9 Billion USD** |
| Countries with subsidies | **12 / ~20 Asian countries** |

**Affordability Index highlights (higher = more affordable relative to income):**
- **Brunei: 236.8** — extreme outlier; government sells fuel at ~$0.31/L to citizens
- **Singapore: ~90, Japan: ~80** — high incomes offset moderate prices
- **China: 25.8, India: 8.0** — despite lower pump prices, fuel represents a large income share
- **Thailand: ~5** — low wages make fuel relatively expensive for locals

**EV adoption leaders:**
- **South Korea (~10%), China (~9.4%)** — major EV manufacturers with strong incentive policies
- **Singapore (~6%), Taiwan (~5%)** — city-states with targeted green transport mandates
- **India (2.1%), Malaysia (2.5%)** — still in early adoption phase

> Asia's **$35.9 Billion in annual fuel subsidies** keeps prices artificially low across 12 countries, but simultaneously suppresses EV transition incentives and contributes to **2,087 MT of transport CO2**.

### Fiscalité — Charge Fiscale Mondiale
![Fiscalité](screenshots/dashboard_fiscalite.png)

**Tax burden indicators:**

| KPI | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Avg gasoline tax rate | **32.7%** |
| Avg total tax per liter | **$0.493 / L** |
| Countries with carbon tax | **11** |
| Highest tax per liter | **$1.280 / L** (Netherlands) |

**Top tax countries (total tax per liter):** Netherlands ($1.28), Norway (~$1.10), France ($1.10), Italy (~$1.05), Germany ($1.00), United Kingdom (~$0.98), Sweden (~$0.95), South Korea (~$0.65)

**Tax burden categories:**
- **Very High** (3 countries, 27%) — taxes represent 60%+ of pump price (Netherlands, Norway, France)
- **High** (4 countries, 36%) — Germany, UK, Sweden, South Korea
- **Moderate** (4 countries, 36%) — Canada, Australia, Brazil, China

**Carbon tax adoption (11 countries):** Canada, France, Germany, Sweden lead. Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia apply 0% fuel tax — purely subsidy-driven pricing.

> **France (58%) and Germany (55%)** — over half of what consumers pay at the pump is government revenue, funding infrastructure and climate transition.

> The contrast between **Netherlands ($1.28/L tax)** and **Iran ($0.00/L tax)** illustrates two opposite energy policy philosophies: fiscal internalization of externalities vs. state-subsidized energy as a social contract.

## ETL Pipeline

The Python ETL (`etl_pipeline.py`) implements a full **Extract → Transform → Load** cycle:

1. **Extract** — reads 6 CSV files with `pandas`
2. **Transform** — per-table cleaning (types, booleans, deduplication, null handling)
3. **Quality checks** — validates nulls, negative prices, data completeness
4. **Load** — writes to SQL Server `staging.*` via SQLAlchemy (`chunked, multi-row inserts`)
5. **DW procedures** — calls 4 stored procedures to populate the star schema
6. **Analytics** — generates regional averages, Top 5 rankings, Brent correlation (r=0.87), exports `analysis_summary.csv`

---

## SQL Server Schema

Three schemas with clear separation of concerns:

| Schema | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `staging` | Raw CSV data loaded by Python |
| `dw` | Star schema — dimensions + fact tables |
| `rpt` | Views consumed directly by Power BI |

**Stored Procedures:**
- `dw.usp_LoadDimCountry` — MERGE upsert for country dimension
- `dw.usp_LoadFactFuelPrices` — full reload of price facts
- `dw.usp_LoadFactCrudeOil` — Brent/WTI annual data
- `dw.usp_LoadFactMonthlyTrend` — monthly trend data
- `dw.usp_RunFullETL` — orchestrates all 4 procedures

---
